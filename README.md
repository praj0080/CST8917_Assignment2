## 1) Azure Functions vs AWS Lambda vs Google Cloud Functions (2nd gen)

### Overview
- **Azure Functions** ‚Äî Managed, event-driven compute with a triggers and bindings programming model that simplifies I/O (e.g. Service bus, Event hubs, Event grid, Storage, HTTP, timers).
- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äî Serverless compute capable of executing code after it has been triggered and auto-scaling; natively integrated with numerous AWS services and API Gateway/EventBridge.   
- **Google Cloud Functions (2nd gen)** ‚Äî Functions based on **Cloud Run** and **Eventarc** and HTTP and event triggers as well as the underlying execution model of Cloud Run. 

### Core features (triggers/bindings)
- **Azure Functions**: The overall number of triggers to be 1 to 1 to a single function; fat *bindings* to input/output (e.g., queue message in -> process -> write to blob).
- **Lambda**: Triggered by numerous sources (API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB streams, SQS/SNS, EventBridge, and so on).
- **GCF (Gen2)**: HTTP, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Audit Logs and so many Eventarc sources.

### Integration options
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps Azure CodePipeline/CodeBuild, AWS; Cloud Build (GCP)  
- **Service integrations**: Bindings (azure), Service Integrations & EventBridge (aws), Eventarc + Connectors (gcp.) 

### Monitoring & observability
- **Azure**: In‚Äëbuilt Application Insights / Azure Monitor. 
- **AWS**: **CloudWatch** metrics/logs (and X-Ray for trace).  
- **GCP**: **Cloud Logging**/**Cloud Monitoring** in Cloud Run/Functions.

### Pricing model (high‚Äëlevel)
- **Azure Functions**: Consumption/Flex per-execution + GBs; Premium per vCPU/single-GBs. 
- **AWS Lambda**: On demand + GB‚Äëseconds (included in free tier). 
- **GCF (Gen2)**: Follows Cloud Run functions pricing (invocations+compute). 

### Strengths & weaknesses (serverless lens)
- **Azure Functions**: Strong bindings minimize boilerplate; ‚àí tight integrations in Azure; - bindings are tied to an Azure‚Äëspecific platform (portability). 
- **AWS Lambda**: + mature environment/ integrations + mature functional tooling ‚Äì default limits/timeouts may need discussion. 
- **GCF (Gen2)**: + based on Cloud Run - mind increased control and scale; + Eventarc sources; - Gen1/Gen2 differences to watch.

## 2) Durable Functions vs AWS Step Functions vs Google Cloud Workflows

### Overview & patterns
- **Durable Functions** adds stateful orchestrations to Azure Functions (chaining of functions, fan-out/fan-in, human interaction).
- **AWS Step Functions** organizes services, Lambdas and state machines (Standard/Express workflows). 
- **Google Cloud Workflows** coordinates Google Cloud services, HTTP endpoints and Cloud Run/Functions. 

### Integration & developer experience
- Visual designers (Workflow Studio on aws), JSON/YAML setting, retries, branching, error handling, parallel steps. 

### Monitoring & observability
- **Azure**: Orchestration history through Durable runtime + Application Insights. 
- **AWS**: Deployment, Execution history, CloudWatch metrics/logs 
- **GCP**: Raspiyas parMeters in Cloud Logging/Monitoring. 

### Pricing model (high‚Äëlevel)
- **Durable Functions**: **Same billing as Functions**; be alert to orchestration/storage interplay on Consumption. 
- **Step Functions**: The charge is unusual divided by **state transition** (there are different rates on Standard/Express). 
- **Workflows**: Per step **executed** (first tier free). 

### Strengths & weaknesses
- **Durable**: + Code‚Äëcentric in familiar language; ‚àí limited to Azure Functions runtime/hosting. 
- **Step Functions**: 200+ service integration, robust patterns; - costs scale with colloquial flows.
- **Workflows**: + Simple YAML and HTTP integrations; - fewer out‚Äëof‚Äëthe- box ‚Äúservice integrations‚Äù than with AWS.

## 3) Azure Logic Apps vs AWS & GCP iPaaS Options

### Overview
- **Logic Apps**: Built‚Äëin and managed connectors (hundreds of SaaS/enterprise systems) low-code workflows. 
- **Closest AWS fit**: **Step Functions** for where orchestration meets **EventBridge** for where events are and **AppFlow**/**partner connectors** where SaaS data flows 
- **Closest GCP fit**: **Application Integration / Integration Connectors** + **Workflows** + **Eventarc**. 

### Integration options
- Drag-drop designers, hundred‚Äôs of out-of-the-box connectors, custom connectors, and HTTP/Webhook support.

### Monitoring & observability
- History, Azure Monitor, diagnostic logs.

### Pricing model (high‚Äëlevel)
- **Logic Apps**: Consumption (action/connector-based metering) or Standard (FIXED compute units). 
- **AWS**: The costs are based on the services that are triggered (Step Functions transitions, EventBridge events, AppFlow runs). 
- **GCP**: Application Integration and connectors priced on a per-use basis; Workflows/ Eventarc charged on a per step/ event basis. 

### Strengths & weaknesses
- **Logic Apps**: + Very expansive connector library; + hybrid capability; √¢ minus, partial cross- cloud portability due to connector availability.

## 4) Service Bus (Queues & Topics) vs SQS/SNS vs Pub/Sub

### Overview
- **Azure Service Bus**: Enterprise broker with queues (competing consumers), topics/subscriptions (pub/sub), sessions when ordered processing is required.  
- **AWS**: **SQS** (queues; standard & FIFO) + **SNS** (topics).  
- **GCP**: Durable pub/sub and streaming ingestion (topics + subscriptions). 

### Integration options
- –£–≤–µ–ª–∏—á–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∞ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤ (—à–∞–±–ª–æ–Ω—ã –¥–ª—è C#, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby). Triggers/bindings (Azure Functions), Lambda event source mappings (SQS/SNS), Cloud Functions triggers (Pub/Sub). 

### Monitoring & observability
- **Azure**: Service Bus telemetry + Azure Monitor metric/logs. 
- **AWS**: SNS/SQS metrics in CloudWatch.  
- **GCP**: Pub/Sub cloud Monitoring/Logging. 

### Pricing model (high‚Äëlevel)
- **Service Bus**: Tiered (Basic/Standard/Premium) + message ops; check out the pricing page.  
- **SQS**: Per API request; there are other dimensions of pricing in FIFO.  
- **SNS**: On operation and kind of delivery (HTTP/SQS/Lambda/SMS, and so on).   
- **Pub/Sub**: Throughput (bytes in/out), storage and network egress. 

### Strengths & weaknesses
- **Service Bus**: + Sessions transactons; ‚àí premium tier requied for strict latency/acaolation.  
- **SQS/SNS**: + Easy/low cost; - two services to glue to make pub/sub.   
- **Pub/Sub**: Global, scale to many orders of magnitude; + queue-like patterns can require more components.

- **Simple API or event processor** ->Functions / Lambda / Cloud Functions.  
- Long running process with retries and parallel branches -> Durable Functions / Step Functions / Workflows.  
- SaaS-to-SaaS automations with little code - Logic Apps / (Step Functions + AppFlow) / (Application Integration + Connectors).  
- Queueing and back-pressure between services -Service Bus / SQS / Pub-Sub (with pull subscribers).  
- Loosely coupled apps event bus** -> Event Grid / EventBridge / Eventarc.  
- **High- Throughput telemetry ingestion** Kinesis Streams / Pub/Sub / Event Hubs.
